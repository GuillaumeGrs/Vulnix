This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of H266 sei messages. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-27381.",

See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information. Only Python versions 3.12 or later are affected by these vulnerabilities, earlier versions don't include the extraction filter feature.\n\nNote that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from \"no filtering\" to `\"data\", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.\n\nNote that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when evaluating source distributions it's important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.",

See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information.\n\nNote that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from \"no filtering\" to `\"data\", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.\n\nNote that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when evaluating source distributions it's important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.",

All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.",

However, while ltp running\nstress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it is\npossible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is\ndestroyed eg:\n\n(umount)\next4_kill_sb\n  kill_block_super\n    generic_shutdown_super\n      sync_filesystem /* commits all txns */\n      evict_inodes\n        /* might start a new txn */\n      ext4_put_super\n\tflush_work(\u0026sbi-\u003es_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */\n        jbd2_journal_destroy\n          journal_kill_thread\n            journal-\u003ej_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;\n          jbd2_journal_commit_transaction\n            jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer\n              jbd2_journal_bmap\n                ext4_journal_bmap\n                  ext4_map_blocks\n                    ...\n                    ext4_inode_error\n                      ext4_handle_error\n                        schedule_work(\u0026sbi-\u003es_sb_upd_work)\n\n                                               /* work queue kicks in */\n                                               update_super_work\n                                                 jbd2_journal_start\n                                                   start_this_handle\n                                                     BUG_ON(journal-\u003ej_flags \u0026\n                                                            JBD2_UNMOUNT)\n\nHence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only do\na journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, just\nfallback to an un-journaled commit.\n\nFurther, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:\n\n  1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.",

Kexec works fine if virtio-console\nis not in use.\n\nThe issue is that virtio-console continues to write to the MMIO even after\nunderlying virtio-pci device is reset.\n\nAdditionally, Eric noticed that IOMMUs are reset before devices, if\ndevices are not reset on shutdown they continue to poke at guest memory\nand get errors from the IOMMU. Some devices get wedged then.\n\nThe problem can be solved by breaking all virtio devices on virtio\nbus shutdown, then resetting them.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before\n\nCurrently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through\nvm_ops-\u003emay_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are\ntaken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our\nprocess and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to\nbe shared again before we actually perform the split.\n\nFix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from\n__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that\npoint, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.\n\nAn annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper\nhugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:\n\n1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:\n    - mmap lock (exclusively)\n    - VMA lock\n    - file rmap lock (exclusively)\n2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to\n   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently\n   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock\n\nBackporting note:\nThis commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit\nb30c14cd6102 (\"hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs\"); that\ncommit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually\nalso go all the way back.\n\n[jannh@google.com: v2]",

If decoding the RPC reply\nfails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the\nrq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a\nvalue stored there.\n\nIf it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that\npointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,\nit could create a memory scribble.\n\nThe server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate\nor pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531\nsays that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected\ninstead with a status of AUTH_ERR.\n\nHandle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of\nAUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This\nsidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in\nthis situation and avoids the crash.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistencies\n\nio_bitmap_exit() is invoked from exit_thread() when a task exists or\nwhen a fork fails. In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up\nresources which were allocated during fork().\n\nio_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up\nin tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the\ncurrent task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,\ntss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThere are two issues, which lead to that problem:\n\n  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when\n     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a\n     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().\n\n  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap\n     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.\n\n     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of\n     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread\n     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.\n\n     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because\n     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and\n     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().\n\nCure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:\n\n  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if\n     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.\n\n  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user\n     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in\n     io_bitmap_share().\n\nFor paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch\nthe case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix udp gso skb_segment after pull from frag_list\n\nCommit a1e40ac5b5e9 (\"net: gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after\npull from frag_list\") detected invalid geometry in frag_list skbs and\nredirects them from skb_segment_list to more robust skb_segment. But some\npackets with modified geometry can also hit bugs in that code. We don't\nknow how many such cases exist. Addressing each one by one also requires\ntouching the complex skb_segment code, which risks introducing bugs for\nother types of skbs. Instead, linearize all these packets that fail the\nbasic invariants on gso fraglist skbs. That is more robust.\n\nIf only part of the fraglist payload is pulled into head_skb, it will\nalways cause exception when splitting skbs by skb_segment. For detailed\ncall stack information, see below.\n\nValid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs\n- consist of two or more segments\n- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size\n- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment\n- all but the last must be gso_size\n\nOptional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can\nmodify fraglist skbs, breaking these invariants.\n\nIn extreme cases they pull one part of data into skb linear. For UDP,\nthis  causes three payloads with lengths of (11,11,10) bytes were\npulled tail to become (12,10,10) bytes.\n\nThe skbs no longer meets the above SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST conditions because\npayload was pulled into head_skb, it needs to be linearized before pass\nto regular skb_segment.\n\n    skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    __udp_gso_segment+0x334/0x5f4\n    udp4_ufo_fragment+0x118/0x15c\n    inet_gso_segment+0x164/0x338\n    skb_mac_gso_segment+0xc4/0x13c\n    __skb_gso_segment+0xc4/0x124\n    validate_xmit_skb+0x9c/0x2c0\n    validate_xmit_skb_list+0x4c/0x80\n    sch_direct_xmit+0x70/0x404\n    __dev_queue_xmit+0x64c/0xe5c\n    neigh_resolve_output+0x178/0x1c4\n    ip_finish_output2+0x37c/0x47c\n    __ip_finish_output+0x194/0x240\n    ip_finish_output+0x20/0xf4\n    ip_output+0x100/0x1a0\n    NF_HOOK+0xc4/0x16c\n    ip_forward+0x314/0x32c\n    ip_rcv+0x90/0x118\n    __netif_receive_skb+0x74/0x124\n    process_backlog+0xe8/0x1a4\n    __napi_poll+0x5c/0x1f8\n    net_rx_action+0x154/0x314\n    handle_softirqs+0x154/0x4b8\n\n    [118.376811] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:bug\u0026]kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:4278!\n    [118.376829] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:traps\u0026]Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n    [118.470774] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]Kernel Offset: 0x178cc00000 from 0xffffffc008000000\n    [118.470810] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]PHYS_OFFSET: 0x40000000\n    [118.470827] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO)\n    [118.470848] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pc : [0xffffffd79598aefc] skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    [118.470900] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]lr : [0xffffffd79598a5e8] skb_segment+0x3bc/0xd14\n    [118.470928] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]sp : ffffffc008013770",

If the device was already zoned,\ndisk-\u003enr_zones would always equal md-\u003enr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()\nreturned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for\nthe device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug\nresources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading\ninvalid memory because disk-\u003econv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.\n\nIf the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the\ncurrent disk-\u003enr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous\nvalue of disk-\u003enr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to\nmatch the previous value that it fell back to.\n\nIf the device already has zone write plug resources,\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is\ncalled for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need\nfor this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads\nthat change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug\nresources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources\nallocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates\nzone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A\ndevice can switch to an error target.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm: fix dm_blk_report_zones\n\nIf dm_get_live_table() returned NULL, dm_put_live_table() was never\ncalled. Also, it is possible that md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map will change\nwhile calling this function. Only read it once, so that we are always\nusing the same value. Otherwise we might miss a call to\ndm_put_live_table().\n\nFinally, while md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map is set and a process is calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() to set up the zone append emulation\nresources, it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by\nblkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones(). If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while\nthe other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error.\n\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will only ever be called when initially\nsetting up the zone append emulation resources, such as when setting up\na zoned dm-crypt table for the first time. Further table swaps will not\nset md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map or call blk_revalidate_disk_zones().\nHowever it must be called using the new table (referenced by\nmd-\u003ezone_revalidate_map) and the new queue limits while the DM device is\nsuspended. dm_blk_report_zones() needs some way to distinguish between a\ncall from blk_revalidate_disk_zones(), which must be allowed to use\nmd-\u003ezone_revalidate_map to access this not yet activated table, and all\nother calls to dm_blk_report_zones(), which should not be allowed while\nthe device is suspended and cannot use md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map, since\nthe zone resources might be freed by the process currently calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones().\n\nSolve this by tracking the process that sets md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map in\ndm_revalidate_zones() and only allowing that process to make use of it\nin dm_blk_report_zones().",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: clear phydev-\u003edevlink when the link is deleted\n\nThere is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the\nnetwork port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls\ndevice_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear\nphydev-\u003edevlink, so phydev-\u003edevlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the\nnetwork port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before\ncalling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the \"error\" label and\ncalls phy_detach(). Since phydev-\u003edevlink retains the old value from\nthe previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,\nwhich accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash\nlog is as follows.\n\n[   24.702421] Call trace:\n[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120\n[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48\n[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168\n[   24.716261]  phy_attach_direct+0x168/0x3a4\n[   24.720352]  phylink_fwnode_phy_connect+0xc8/0x14c\n[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34\n\nTherefore, phydev-\u003edevlink needs to be cleared when the device link is\ndeleted.",

Systems without SME are unaffected.\n\nIf the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch\nto a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will\nrestore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while\nthe CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()\nsubsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an\nSMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from\nstreaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of\nFPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.\n\nFix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel\nFPSIMD state.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps\n\nThe logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state\nincorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having\nTIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state\nis stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from\ndo_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:\n\n|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */\n|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))\n|                WARN_ON(1);\n\nThis is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:\n\n  751ecf6afd6568ad (\"arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps\")\n\nThe race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and\nafter manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on\nthe same CPU, e.g.\n\n| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)\n| {\n|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled\n|         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is 0.\n|         // per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.\n|\n|         ...\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.\n|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.\n|\n|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */\n|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))\n|                 WARN_ON(1);\n|\n|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {\n|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =\n|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;\n|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);\n|\n|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();\n|         }\n|\n|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.\n|         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is still 0\n|         // If per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:\n|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)\n|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared\n|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore\n| }\n\nFix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set\nby calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU\nstate. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the\nstale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the\nnew state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.\n\nNote: this was originallly posted as [1].\n\n[ Rutland: rewrite commit message ]",

[0]\n\nThe NULL is of struct sock, which was fetched by sk_to_full_sk() in\ncalipso_req_setattr().\n\nSince commit a1a5344ddbe8 (\"tcp: avoid two atomic ops for syncookies\"),\nreqsk-\u003ersk_listener could be NULL when SYN Cookie is returned to its\nclient, as hinted by the leading SYN Cookie log.\n\nHere are 3 options to fix the bug:\n\n  1) Return 0 in calipso_req_setattr()\n  2) Return an error in calipso_req_setattr()\n  3) Alaways set rsk_listener\n\n1) is no go as it bypasses LSM, but 2) effectively disables SYN Cookie\nfor CALIPSO.  3) is also no go as there have been many efforts to reduce\natomic ops and make TCP robust against DDoS.  See also commit 3b24d854cb35\n(\"tcp/dccp: do not touch listener sk_refcnt under synflood\").\n\nAs of the blamed commit, SYN Cookie already did not need refcounting,\nand no one has stumbled on the bug for 9 years, so no CALIPSO user will\ncare about SYN Cookie.\n\nLet's return an error in calipso_req_setattr() and calipso_req_delattr()\nin the SYN Cookie case.\n\nThis can be reproduced by [1] on Fedora and now connect() of nc times out.\n\n[0]:\nTCP: request_sock_TCPv6: Possible SYN flooding on port [::]:20002.

Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an\nexpectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause\nestablished config-item access to start failing.\n\nThat expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),\ntsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail\nif tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()\ntsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the\nmissing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.\n\nNow, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,\nit leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The\nexpectation is that the admin that arranges for the -\u003eremove() (unbind)\nof the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all\nopen config-items. Until that deletion happens, -\u003eprobe() (reload /\nbind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.\n\nThis allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation\ninterfaces, and requires coordinated restart.",

          "Title": "kernel: bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration",
          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack\n---truncated---",

[0]\n\nFrom the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while\nits device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.\n\nOnce the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls\nhci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct\nvhci_data, which is set to hci_dev-\u003edev-\u003edriver_data.\n\nThe problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking\nhdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be\nanother thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before\nthe unlink operation.\n\nWe can use SRCU for such synchronisation.\n\nLet's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion\nin hci_unregister_dev().\n\nAnother option would be to restore hci_dev-\u003edestruct(), which was\nremoved in commit 587ae086f6e4 (\"Bluetooth: Remove unused\nhci-destruct cb\").  However, this would not be a good solution, as\nwe should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight\nioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.\n\nNote that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,\nvirtbt_remove().\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88807cb8d858 by task syz.1.219/6718\n\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 6718 Comm: syz.1.219 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-syzkaller-00196-g08207f42d3ff #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/07/2025\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x189/0x250 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:408 [inline]\n print_report+0xd2/0x2b0 mm/kasan/report.c:521\n kasan_report+0x118/0x150 mm/kasan/report.c:634\n skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\n skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\n skb_queue_purge include/linux/skbuff.h:3368 [inline]\n vhci_flush+0x44/0x50 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:69\n hci_dev_do_reset net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:552 [inline]\n hci_dev_reset+0x420/0x5c0 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:592\n sock_do_ioctl+0xd9/0x300 net/socket.c:1190\n sock_ioctl+0x576/0x790 net/socket.c:1311\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:907 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl+0xf9/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:893\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xfa/0x3b0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\nRIP: 0033:0x7fcf5b98e929\nCode: ff ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 a8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007fcf5c7b9038 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007fcf5bbb6160 RCX: 00007fcf5b98e929\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000400448cb RDI: 0000000000000009\nRBP: 00007fcf5ba10b39 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00007fcf5bbb6160 R15: 00007ffd6353d528\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 6535:\n kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n kasan_save_track+0x3e/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n poison_kmalloc_redzone mm/kasan/common.c:377 [inline]\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x93/0xb0 mm/kasan/common.c:394\n kasan_kmalloc include/linux/kasan.h:260 [inline]\n __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x230/0x3d0 mm/slub.c:4359\n kmalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:905 [inline]\n kzalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:1039 [inline]\n vhci_open+0x57/0x360 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:635\n misc_open+0x2bc/0x330 drivers/char/misc.c:161\n chrdev_open+0x4c9/0x5e0 fs/char_dev.c:414\n do_dentry_open+0xdf0/0x1970 fs/open.c:964\n vfs_open+0x3b/0x340 fs/open.c:1094\n do_open fs/namei.c:3887 [inline]\n path_openat+0x2ee5/0x3830 fs/name\n---truncated---",

The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.",

All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.",

Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.",

Use that flag at\nk3_udma_glue_reset_rx_chn() to deicide if the FDQ needs\nto be cleared for every flow or just for flow 0.\n\nFixes the below issue on ti_am65_cpsw_nuss driver on AM62-SK.\n\n\u003e ip link set eth1 down\n\u003e ip link set eth0 down\n\u003e ethtool -L eth0 rx 8\n\u003e ip link set eth0 up\n\u003e modprobe -r ti_am65_cpsw_nuss\n\n[  103.045726] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  103.050505] k3_knav_desc_pool size 512000 != avail 64000\n[  103.050703] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 450 at drivers/net/ethernet/ti/k3-cppi-desc-pool.c:33 k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.068810] Modules linked in: ti_am65_cpsw_nuss(-) k3_cppi_desc_pool snd_soc_hdmi_codec crct10dif_ce snd_soc_simple_card snd_soc_simple_card_utils display_connector rtc_ti_k3 k3_j72xx_bandgap tidss drm_client_lib snd_soc_davinci_mcas\np drm_dma_helper tps6598x phylink snd_soc_ti_udma rti_wdt drm_display_helper snd_soc_tlv320aic3x_i2c typec at24 phy_gmii_sel snd_soc_ti_edma snd_soc_tlv320aic3x sii902x snd_soc_ti_sdma sa2ul omap_mailbox drm_kms_helper authenc cfg80211 r\nfkill fuse drm drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight ip_tables x_tables ipv6 [last unloaded: k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.119950] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 450 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 6.13.0-rc7-00001-g9c5e3435fa66 #1011\n[  103.119968] Hardware name: Texas Instruments AM625 SK (DT)\n[  103.119974] pstate: 80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  103.119983] pc : k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.148007] lr : k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.154709] sp : ffff8000826ebbc0\n[  103.158015] x29: ffff8000826ebbc0 x28: ffff0000090b6300 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  103.165145] x26: 0000000000000000 x25: 0000000000000000 x24: ffff0000019df6b0\n[  103.172271] x23: ffff0000019df6b8 x22: ffff0000019df410 x21: ffff8000826ebc88\n[  103.179397] x20: 000000000007d000 x19: ffff00000a3b3000 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  103.186522] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000 x15: 000001e8c35e1cde\n[  103.193647] x14: 0000000000000396 x13: 000000000000035c x12: 0000000000000000\n[  103.200772] x11: 000000000000003a x10: 00000000000009c0 x9 : ffff8000826eba20\n[  103.207897] x8 : ffff0000090b6d20 x7 : ffff00007728c180 x6 : ffff00007728c100\n[  103.215022] x5 : 0000000000000001 x4 : ffff000000508a50 x3 : ffff7ffff6146000\n[  103.222147] x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : e300b4173ee6b200 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  103.229274] Call trace:\n[  103.231714]  k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool] (P)\n[  103.238408]  am65_cpsw_nuss_free_rx_chns+0x28/0x4c [ti_am65_cpsw_nuss]\n[  103.244942]  devm_action_release+0x14/0x20\n[  103.249040]  release_nodes+0x3c/0x68\n[  103.252610]  devres_release_all+0x8c/0xdc\n[  103.256614]  device_unbind_cleanup+0x18/0x60\n[  103.260876]  device_release_driver_internal+0xf8/0x178\n[  103.266004]  driver_detach+0x50/0x9c\n[  103.269571]  bus_remove_driver+0x6c/0xbc\n[  103.273485]  driver_unregister+0x30/0x60\n[  103.277401]  platform_driver_unregister+0x14/0x20\n[  103.282096]  am65_cpsw_nuss_driver_exit+0x18/0xff4 [ti_am65_cpsw_nuss]\n[  103.288620]  __arm64_sys_delete_module+0x17c/0x25c\n[  103.293404]  invoke_syscall+0x44/0x100\n[  103.297149]  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xc0/0xe0\n[  103.301845]  do_el0_svc+0x1c/0x28\n[  103.305155]  el0_svc+0x28/0x98\n---truncated---",

Kexec works fine if virtio-console\nis not in use.\n\nThe issue is that virtio-console continues to write to the MMIO even after\nunderlying virtio-pci device is reset.\n\nAdditionally, Eric noticed that IOMMUs are reset before devices, if\ndevices are not reset on shutdown they continue to poke at guest memory\nand get errors from the IOMMU. Some devices get wedged then.\n\nThe problem can be solved by breaking all virtio devices on virtio\nbus shutdown, then resetting them.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before\n\nCurrently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through\nvm_ops-\u003emay_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are\ntaken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our\nprocess and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to\nbe shared again before we actually perform the split.\n\nFix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from\n__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that\npoint, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.\n\nAn annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper\nhugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:\n\n1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:\n    - mmap lock (exclusively)\n    - VMA lock\n    - file rmap lock (exclusively)\n2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to\n   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently\n   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock\n\nBackporting note:\nThis commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit\nb30c14cd6102 (\"hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs\"); that\ncommit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually\nalso go all the way back.\n\n[jannh@google.com: v2]",

If decoding the RPC reply\nfails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the\nrq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a\nvalue stored there.\n\nIf it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that\npointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,\nit could create a memory scribble.\n\nThe server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate\nor pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531\nsays that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected\ninstead with a status of AUTH_ERR.\n\nHandle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of\nAUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This\nsidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in\nthis situation and avoids the crash.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistencies\n\nio_bitmap_exit() is invoked from exit_thread() when a task exists or\nwhen a fork fails. In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up\nresources which were allocated during fork().\n\nio_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up\nin tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the\ncurrent task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,\ntss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThere are two issues, which lead to that problem:\n\n  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when\n     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a\n     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().\n\n  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap\n     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.\n\n     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of\n     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread\n     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.\n\n     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because\n     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and\n     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().\n\nCure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:\n\n  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if\n     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.\n\n  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user\n     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in\n     io_bitmap_share().\n\nFor paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch\nthe case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix udp gso skb_segment after pull from frag_list\n\nCommit a1e40ac5b5e9 (\"net: gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after\npull from frag_list\") detected invalid geometry in frag_list skbs and\nredirects them from skb_segment_list to more robust skb_segment. But some\npackets with modified geometry can also hit bugs in that code. We don't\nknow how many such cases exist. Addressing each one by one also requires\ntouching the complex skb_segment code, which risks introducing bugs for\nother types of skbs. Instead, linearize all these packets that fail the\nbasic invariants on gso fraglist skbs. That is more robust.\n\nIf only part of the fraglist payload is pulled into head_skb, it will\nalways cause exception when splitting skbs by skb_segment. For detailed\ncall stack information, see below.\n\nValid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs\n- consist of two or more segments\n- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size\n- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment\n- all but the last must be gso_size\n\nOptional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can\nmodify fraglist skbs, breaking these invariants.\n\nIn extreme cases they pull one part of data into skb linear. For UDP,\nthis  causes three payloads with lengths of (11,11,10) bytes were\npulled tail to become (12,10,10) bytes.\n\nThe skbs no longer meets the above SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST conditions because\npayload was pulled into head_skb, it needs to be linearized before pass\nto regular skb_segment.\n\n    skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    __udp_gso_segment+0x334/0x5f4\n    udp4_ufo_fragment+0x118/0x15c\n    inet_gso_segment+0x164/0x338\n    skb_mac_gso_segment+0xc4/0x13c\n    __skb_gso_segment+0xc4/0x124\n    validate_xmit_skb+0x9c/0x2c0\n    validate_xmit_skb_list+0x4c/0x80\n    sch_direct_xmit+0x70/0x404\n    __dev_queue_xmit+0x64c/0xe5c\n    neigh_resolve_output+0x178/0x1c4\n    ip_finish_output2+0x37c/0x47c\n    __ip_finish_output+0x194/0x240\n    ip_finish_output+0x20/0xf4\n    ip_output+0x100/0x1a0\n    NF_HOOK+0xc4/0x16c\n    ip_forward+0x314/0x32c\n    ip_rcv+0x90/0x118\n    __netif_receive_skb+0x74/0x124\n    process_backlog+0xe8/0x1a4\n    __napi_poll+0x5c/0x1f8\n    net_rx_action+0x154/0x314\n    handle_softirqs+0x154/0x4b8\n\n    [118.376811] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:bug\u0026]kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:4278!\n    [118.376829] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:traps\u0026]Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n    [118.470774] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]Kernel Offset: 0x178cc00000 from 0xffffffc008000000\n    [118.470810] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]PHYS_OFFSET: 0x40000000\n    [118.470827] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO)\n    [118.470848] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pc : [0xffffffd79598aefc] skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    [118.470900] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]lr : [0xffffffd79598a5e8] skb_segment+0x3bc/0xd14\n    [118.470928] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]sp : ffffffc008013770",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm: limit swapping tables for devices with zone write plugs\n\ndm_revalidate_zones() only allowed new or previously unzoned devices to\ncall blk_revalidate_disk_zones(). If the device was already zoned,\ndisk-\u003enr_zones would always equal md-\u003enr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()\nreturned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for\nthe device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug\nresources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading\ninvalid memory because disk-\u003econv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.\n\nIf the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the\ncurrent disk-\u003enr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous\nvalue of disk-\u003enr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to\nmatch the previous value that it fell back to.\n\nIf the device already has zone write plug resources,\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is\ncalled for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need\nfor this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads\nthat change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug\nresources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources\nallocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates\nzone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A\ndevice can switch to an error target.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm: fix dm_blk_report_zones\n\nIf dm_get_live_table() returned NULL, dm_put_live_table() was never\ncalled. Also, it is possible that md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map will change\nwhile calling this function. Only read it once, so that we are always\nusing the same value. Otherwise we might miss a call to\ndm_put_live_table().\n\nFinally, while md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map is set and a process is calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() to set up the zone append emulation\nresources, it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by\nblkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones(). If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while\nthe other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error.\n\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will only ever be called when initially\nsetting up the zone append emulation resources, such as when setting up\na zoned dm-crypt table for the first time. Further table swaps will not\nset md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map or call blk_revalidate_disk_zones().\nHowever it must be called using the new table (referenced by\nmd-\u003ezone_revalidate_map) and the new queue limits while the DM device is\nsuspended. dm_blk_report_zones() needs some way to distinguish between a\ncall from blk_revalidate_disk_zones(), which must be allowed to use\nmd-\u003ezone_revalidate_map to access this not yet activated table, and all\nother calls to dm_blk_report_zones(), which should not be allowed while\nthe device is suspended and cannot use md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map, since\nthe zone resources might be freed by the process currently calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones().\n\nSolve this by tracking the process that sets md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map in\ndm_revalidate_zones() and only allowing that process to make use of it\nin dm_blk_report_zones().",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: clear phydev-\u003edevlink when the link is deleted\n\nThere is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the\nnetwork port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls\ndevice_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear\nphydev-\u003edevlink, so phydev-\u003edevlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the\nnetwork port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before\ncalling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the \"error\" label and\ncalls phy_detach(). Since phydev-\u003edevlink retains the old value from\nthe previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,\nwhich accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash\nlog is as follows.\n\n[   24.702421] Call trace:\n[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120\n[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48\n[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168\n[   24.716261]  phy_attach_direct+0x168/0x3a4\n[   24.720352]  phylink_fwnode_phy_connect+0xc8/0x14c\n[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34\n\nTherefore, phydev-\u003edevlink needs to be cleared when the device link is\ndeleted.",

Systems without SME are unaffected.\n\nIf the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch\nto a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will\nrestore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while\nthe CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()\nsubsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an\nSMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from\nstreaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of\nFPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.\n\nFix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel\nFPSIMD state.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps\n\nThe logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state\nincorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having\nTIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state\nis stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from\ndo_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:\n\n|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */\n|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))\n|                WARN_ON(1);\n\nThis is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:\n\n  751ecf6afd6568ad (\"arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps\")\n\nThe race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and\nafter manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on\nthe same CPU, e.g.\n\n| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)\n| {\n|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled\n|         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is 0.\n|         // per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.\n|\n|         ...\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.\n|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.\n|\n|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */\n|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))\n|                 WARN_ON(1);\n|\n|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {\n|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =\n|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;\n|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);\n|\n|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();\n|         }\n|\n|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.\n|         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is still 0\n|         // If per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:\n|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)\n|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared\n|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore\n| }\n\nFix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set\nby calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU\nstate. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the\nstale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the\nnew state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.\n\nNote: this was originallly posted as [1].\n\n[ Rutland: rewrite commit message ]",

[0]\n\nThe NULL is of struct sock, which was fetched by sk_to_full_sk() in\ncalipso_req_setattr().\n\nSince commit a1a5344ddbe8 (\"tcp: avoid two atomic ops for syncookies\"),\nreqsk-\u003ersk_listener could be NULL when SYN Cookie is returned to its\nclient, as hinted by the leading SYN Cookie log.\n\nHere are 3 options to fix the bug:\n\n  1) Return 0 in calipso_req_setattr()\n  2) Return an error in calipso_req_setattr()\n  3) Alaways set rsk_listener\n\n1) is no go as it bypasses LSM, but 2) effectively disables SYN Cookie\nfor CALIPSO.  3) is also no go as there have been many efforts to reduce\natomic ops and make TCP robust against DDoS.  See also commit 3b24d854cb35\n(\"tcp/dccp: do not touch listener sk_refcnt under synflood\").\n\nAs of the blamed commit, SYN Cookie already did not need refcounting,\nand no one has stumbled on the bug for 9 years, so no CALIPSO user will\ncare about SYN Cookie.\n\nLet's return an error in calipso_req_setattr() and calipso_req_delattr()\nin the SYN Cookie case.\n\nThis can be reproduced by [1] on Fedora and now connect() of nc times out.\n\n[0]:\nTCP: request_sock_TCPv6: Possible SYN flooding on port [::]:20002.

Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an\nexpectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause\nestablished config-item access to start failing.\n\nThat expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),\ntsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail\nif tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()\ntsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the\nmissing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.\n\nNow, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,\nit leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The\nexpectation is that the admin that arranges for the -\u003eremove() (unbind)\nof the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all\nopen config-items. Until that deletion happens, -\u003eprobe() (reload /\nbind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.\n\nThis allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation\ninterfaces, and requires coordinated restart.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.\n\nJann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().\n\nThe following sequences reproduce the issue:\n\n  $ python3\n  from socket import *\n  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)\n  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb\n  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb\n  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)\n\nEven though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on\nthe recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().\n\nAfter the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has\n2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.\n\nThen, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB\n\n  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb\n  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb\n  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb\n  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb\n\n, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.\n\nThe 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not\nexpect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed\nOOB skbs.\n\n  while (skip \u003e= unix_skb_len(skb)) {\n    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);\n    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, \u0026sk-\u003esk_receive_queue);\n    ...\n  }\n\nIn addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that\nioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed\nOOB skbs.\n\nSo, nothing good comes out of such a situation.\n\nInstead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next\nECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,\nlet's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.\n\nNow, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its\nprevious skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in unix_stream_read_actor (net/unix/af_unix.c:3027)\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff888106ef2904 by task python3/315\n\nCPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 315 Comm: python3 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-00407-gec315832f6f9 #8 PREEMPT(voluntary)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-4.fc42 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:122)\n print_report (mm/kasan/report.c:409 mm/kasan/report.c:521)\n kasan_report (mm/kasan/report.c:636)\n unix_stream_read_actor (net/unix/af_unix.c:3027)\n unix_stream_read_generic (net/unix/af_unix.c:2708 net/unix/af_unix.c:2847)\n unix_stream_recvmsg (net/unix/af_unix.c:3048)\n sock_recvmsg (net/socket.c:1063 (discriminator 20) net/socket.c:1085 (discriminator 20))\n __sys_recvfrom (net/socket.c:2278)\n __x64_sys_recvfrom (net/socket.c:2291 (discriminator 1) net/socket.c:2287 (discriminator 1) net/socket.c:2287 (discriminator 1))\n do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 (discriminator 1) arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94 (discriminator 1))\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)\nRIP: 0033:0x7f8911fcea06\nCode: 5d e8 41 8b 93 08 03 00 00 59 5e 48 83 f8 fc 75 19 83 e2 39 83 fa 08 75 11 e8 26 ff ff ff 66 0f 1f 44 00 00 48 8b 45 10 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 8b 5d f8 c9 c3 0f 1f 40 00 f3 0f 1e fa 55 48 89 e5 48 83 ec 08\nRSP: 002b:00007fffdb0dccb0 EFLAGS: 00000202 ORIG_RAX: 000000000000002d\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007fffdb0dcdc8 RCX: 00007f8911fcea06\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: 00007f8911a5e060 RDI: 0000000000000006\nRBP: 00007fffdb0dccd0 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000202 R12: 00007f89119a7d20\nR13: ffffffffc4653600 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 315:\n kasan_save_stack (mm/kasan/common.c:48)\n kasan_save_track (mm/kasan/common.c:60 (discriminator 1) mm/kasan/common.c:69 (discriminator 1))\n __kasan_slab_alloc (mm/kasan/common.c:348)\n kmem_cache_alloc_\n---truncated---",

          "Title": "kernel: bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration",
          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack\n---truncated---",

[0]\n\nFrom the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while\nits device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.\n\nOnce the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls\nhci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct\nvhci_data, which is set to hci_dev-\u003edev-\u003edriver_data.\n\nThe problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking\nhdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be\nanother thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before\nthe unlink operation.\n\nWe can use SRCU for such synchronisation.\n\nLet's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion\nin hci_unregister_dev().\n\nAnother option would be to restore hci_dev-\u003edestruct(), which was\nremoved in commit 587ae086f6e4 (\"Bluetooth: Remove unused\nhci-destruct cb\").  However, this would not be a good solution, as\nwe should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight\nioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.\n\nNote that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,\nvirtbt_remove().\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88807cb8d858 by task syz.1.219/6718\n\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 6718 Comm: syz.1.219 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-syzkaller-00196-g08207f42d3ff #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/07/2025\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x189/0x250 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:408 [inline]\n print_report+0xd2/0x2b0 mm/kasan/report.c:521\n kasan_report+0x118/0x150 mm/kasan/report.c:634\n skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\n skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\n skb_queue_purge include/linux/skbuff.h:3368 [inline]\n vhci_flush+0x44/0x50 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:69\n hci_dev_do_reset net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:552 [inline]\n hci_dev_reset+0x420/0x5c0 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:592\n sock_do_ioctl+0xd9/0x300 net/socket.c:1190\n sock_ioctl+0x576/0x790 net/socket.c:1311\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:907 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl+0xf9/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:893\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xfa/0x3b0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\nRIP: 0033:0x7fcf5b98e929\nCode: ff ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 a8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007fcf5c7b9038 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007fcf5bbb6160 RCX: 00007fcf5b98e929\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000400448cb RDI: 0000000000000009\nRBP: 00007fcf5ba10b39 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00007fcf5bbb6160 R15: 00007ffd6353d528\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 6535:\n kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n kasan_save_track+0x3e/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n poison_kmalloc_redzone mm/kasan/common.c:377 [inline]\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x93/0xb0 mm/kasan/common.c:394\n kasan_kmalloc include/linux/kasan.h:260 [inline]\n __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x230/0x3d0 mm/slub.c:4359\n kmalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:905 [inline]\n kzalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:1039 [inline]\n vhci_open+0x57/0x360 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:635\n misc_open+0x2bc/0x330 drivers/char/misc.c:161\n chrdev_open+0x4c9/0x5e0 fs/char_dev.c:414\n do_dentry_open+0xdf0/0x1970 fs/open.c:964\n vfs_open+0x3b/0x340 fs/open.c:1094\n do_open fs/namei.c:3887 [inline]\n path_openat+0x2ee5/0x3830 fs/name\n---truncated---",

The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.",

All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.",

Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.",

Kexec works fine if virtio-console\nis not in use.\n\nThe issue is that virtio-console continues to write to the MMIO even after\nunderlying virtio-pci device is reset.\n\nAdditionally, Eric noticed that IOMMUs are reset before devices, if\ndevices are not reset on shutdown they continue to poke at guest memory\nand get errors from the IOMMU. Some devices get wedged then.\n\nThe problem can be solved by breaking all virtio devices on virtio\nbus shutdown, then resetting them.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before\n\nCurrently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through\nvm_ops-\u003emay_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are\ntaken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our\nprocess and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to\nbe shared again before we actually perform the split.\n\nFix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from\n__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that\npoint, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.\n\nAn annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper\nhugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:\n\n1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:\n    - mmap lock (exclusively)\n    - VMA lock\n    - file rmap lock (exclusively)\n2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to\n   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently\n   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock\n\nBackporting note:\nThis commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit\nb30c14cd6102 (\"hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs\"); that\ncommit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually\nalso go all the way back.\n\n[jannh@google.com: v2]",

If decoding the RPC reply\nfails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the\nrq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a\nvalue stored there.\n\nIf it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that\npointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,\nit could create a memory scribble.\n\nThe server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate\nor pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531\nsays that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected\ninstead with a status of AUTH_ERR.\n\nHandle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of\nAUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case.

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistencies\n\nio_bitmap_exit() is invoked from exit_thread() when a task exists or\nwhen a fork fails. In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up\nresources which were allocated during fork().\n\nio_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up\nin tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the\ncurrent task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,\ntss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThere are two issues, which lead to that problem:\n\n  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when\n     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a\n     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().\n\n  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap\n     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.\n\n     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of\n     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread\n     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.\n\n     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because\n     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and\n     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().\n\nCure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:\n\n  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if\n     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.\n\n  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user\n     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in\n     io_bitmap_share().\n\nFor paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch\nthe case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix udp gso skb_segment after pull from frag_list\n\nCommit a1e40ac5b5e9 (\"net: gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after\npull from frag_list\") detected invalid geometry in frag_list skbs and\nredirects them from skb_segment_list to more robust skb_segment. But some\npackets with modified geometry can also hit bugs in that code. We don't\nknow how many such cases exist. Addressing each one by one also requires\ntouching the complex skb_segment code, which risks introducing bugs for\nother types of skbs. Instead, linearize all these packets that fail the\nbasic invariants on gso fraglist skbs. That is more robust.\n\nIf only part of the fraglist payload is pulled into head_skb, it will\nalways cause exception when splitting skbs by skb_segment. For detailed\ncall stack information, see below.\n\nValid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs\n- consist of two or more segments\n- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size\n- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment\n- all but the last must be gso_size\n\nOptional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can\nmodify fraglist skbs, breaking these invariants.\n\nIn extreme cases they pull one part of data into skb linear. For UDP,\nthis  causes three payloads with lengths of (11,11,10) bytes were\npulled tail to become (12,10,10) bytes.\n\nThe skbs no longer meets the above SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST conditions because\npayload was pulled into head_skb, it needs to be linearized before pass\nto regular skb_segment.\n\n    skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    __udp_gso_segment+0x334/0x5f4\n    udp4_ufo_fragment+0x118/0x15c\n    inet_gso_segment+0x164/0x338\n    skb_mac_gso_segment+0xc4/0x13c\n    __skb_gso_segment+0xc4/0x124\n    validate_xmit_skb+0x9c/0x2c0\n    validate_xmit_skb_list+0x4c/0x80\n    sch_direct_xmit+0x70/0x404\n    __dev_queue_xmit+0x64c/0xe5c\n    neigh_resolve_output+0x178/0x1c4\n    ip_finish_output2+0x37c/0x47c\n    __ip_finish_output+0x194/0x240\n    ip_finish_output+0x20/0xf4\n    ip_output+0x100/0x1a0\n    NF_HOOK+0xc4/0x16c\n    ip_forward+0x314/0x32c\n    ip_rcv+0x90/0x118\n    __netif_receive_skb+0x74/0x124\n    process_backlog+0xe8/0x1a4\n    __napi_poll+0x5c/0x1f8\n    net_rx_action+0x154/0x314\n    handle_softirqs+0x154/0x4b8\n\n    [118.376811] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:bug\u0026]kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:4278!\n    [118.376829] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:traps\u0026]Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n    [118.470774] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]Kernel Offset: 0x178cc00000 from 0xffffffc008000000\n    [118.470810] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]PHYS_OFFSET: 0x40000000\n    [118.470827] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO)\n    [118.470848] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pc : [0xffffffd79598aefc] skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    [118.470900] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]lr : [0xffffffd79598a5e8] skb_segment+0x3bc/0xd14\n    [118.470928] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]sp : ffffffc008013770",

If the device was already zoned,\ndisk-\u003enr_zones would always equal md-\u003enr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()\nreturned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for\nthe device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug\nresources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading\ninvalid memory because disk-\u003econv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.\n\nIf the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the\ncurrent disk-\u003enr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous\nvalue of disk-\u003enr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to\nmatch the previous value that it fell back to.\n\nIf the device already has zone write plug resources,\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is\ncalled for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need\nfor this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads\nthat change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug\nresources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources\nallocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates\nzone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A\ndevice can switch to an error target.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm: fix dm_blk_report_zones\n\nIf dm_get_live_table() returned NULL, dm_put_live_table() was never\ncalled. Also, it is possible that md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map will change\nwhile calling this function. Only read it once, so that we are always\nusing the same value. Otherwise we might miss a call to\ndm_put_live_table().\n\nFinally, while md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map is set and a process is calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() to set up the zone append emulation\nresources, it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by\nblkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones(). If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while\nthe other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error.\n\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will only ever be called when initially\nsetting up the zone append emulation resources, such as when setting up\na zoned dm-crypt table for the first time. Further table swaps will not\nset md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map or call blk_revalidate_disk_zones().\nHowever it must be called using the new table (referenced by\nmd-\u003ezone_revalidate_map) and the new queue limits while the DM device is\nsuspended. dm_blk_report_zones() needs some way to distinguish between a\ncall from blk_revalidate_disk_zones(), which must be allowed to use\nmd-\u003ezone_revalidate_map to access this not yet activated table, and all\nother calls to dm_blk_report_zones(), which should not be allowed while\nthe device is suspended and cannot use md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map, since\nthe zone resources might be freed by the process currently calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones().\n\nSolve this by tracking the process that sets md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map in\ndm_revalidate_zones() and only allowing that process to make use of it\nin dm_blk_report_zones().",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: clear phydev-\u003edevlink when the link is deleted\n\nThere is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the\nnetwork port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls\ndevice_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear\nphydev-\u003edevlink, so phydev-\u003edevlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the\nnetwork port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before\ncalling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the \"error\" label and\ncalls phy_detach(). Since phydev-\u003edevlink retains the old value from\nthe previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,\nwhich accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash\nlog is as follows.\n\n[   24.702421] Call trace:\n[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120\n[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48\n[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168\n[   24.716261]  phy_attach_direct+0x168/0x3a4\n[   24.720352]  phylink_fwnode_phy_connect+0xc8/0x14c\n[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34\n\nTherefore, phydev-\u003edevlink needs to be cleared when the device link is\ndeleted.",

Systems without SME are unaffected.\n\nIf the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch\nto a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will\nrestore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while\nthe CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()\nsubsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an\nSMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from\nstreaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of\nFPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.\n\nFix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel\nFPSIMD state.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps\n\nThe logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state\nincorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having\nTIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state\nis stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from\ndo_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:\n\n|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */\n|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))\n|                WARN_ON(1);\n\nThis is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:\n\n  751ecf6afd6568ad (\"arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps\")\n\nThe race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and\nafter manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on\nthe same CPU, e.g.\n\n| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)\n| {\n|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled\n|         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is 0.\n|         // per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.\n|\n|         ...\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.\n|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.\n|\n|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */\n|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))\n|                 WARN_ON(1);\n|\n|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {\n|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =\n|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;\n|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);\n|\n|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();\n|         }\n|\n|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.\n|         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is still 0\n|         // If per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:\n|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)\n|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared\n|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore\n| }\n\nFix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set\nby calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU\nstate. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the\nstale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the\nnew state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.\n\nNote: this was originallly posted as [1].\n\n[ Rutland: rewrite commit message ]",

[0]\n\nThe NULL is of struct sock, which was fetched by sk_to_full_sk() in\ncalipso_req_setattr().\n\nSince commit a1a5344ddbe8 (\"tcp: avoid two atomic ops for syncookies\"),\nreqsk-\u003ersk_listener could be NULL when SYN Cookie is returned to its\nclient, as hinted by the leading SYN Cookie log.\n\nHere are 3 options to fix the bug:\n\n  1) Return 0 in calipso_req_setattr()\n  2) Return an error in calipso_req_setattr()\n  3) Alaways set rsk_listener\n\n1) is no go as it bypasses LSM, but 2) effectively disables SYN Cookie\nfor CALIPSO.  3) is also no go as there have been many efforts to reduce\natomic ops and make TCP robust against DDoS.  See also commit 3b24d854cb35\n(\"tcp/dccp: do not touch listener sk_refcnt under synflood\").\n\nAs of the blamed commit, SYN Cookie already did not need refcounting,\nand no one has stumbled on the bug for 9 years, so no CALIPSO user will\ncare about SYN Cookie.\n\nLet's return an error in calipso_req_setattr() and calipso_req_delattr()\nin the SYN Cookie case.\n\nThis can be reproduced by [1] on Fedora and now connect() of nc times out.\n\n[0]:\nTCP: request_sock_TCPv6: Possible SYN flooding on port [::]:20002.

Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an\nexpectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause\nestablished config-item access to start failing.\n\nThat expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),\ntsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail\nif tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()\ntsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the\nmissing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.\n\nNow, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,\nit leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The\nexpectation is that the admin that arranges for the -\u003eremove() (unbind)\nof the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all\nopen config-items. Until that deletion happens, -\u003eprobe() (reload /\nbind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.\n\nThis allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation\ninterfaces, and requires coordinated restart.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.\n\nJann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().\n\nThe following sequences reproduce the issue:\n\n  $ python3\n  from socket import *\n  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)\n  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb\n  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb\n  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)\n\nEven though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on\nthe recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().\n\nAfter the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has\n2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.\n\nThen, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB\n\n  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb\n  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb\n  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb\n  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb\n\n, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.\n\nThe 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not\nexpect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed\nOOB skbs.\n\n  while (skip \u003e= unix_skb_len(skb)) {\n    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);\n    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, \u0026sk-\u003esk_receive_queue);\n    ...\n  }\n\nIn addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that\nioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed\nOOB skbs.\n\nSo, nothing good comes out of such a situation.\n\nInstead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next\nECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,\nlet's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.\n\nNow, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its\nprevious skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in unix_stream_read_actor (net/unix/af_unix.c:3027)\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff888106ef2904 by task python3/315\n\nCPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 315 Comm: python3 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-00407-gec315832f6f9 #8 PREEMPT(voluntary)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-4.fc42 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:122)\n print_report (mm/kasan/report.c:409 mm/kasan/report.c:521)\n kasan_report (mm/kasan/report.c:636)\n unix_stream_read_actor (net/unix/af_unix.c:3027)\n unix_stream_read_generic (net/unix/af_unix.c:2708 net/unix/af_unix.c:2847)\n unix_stream_recvmsg (net/unix/af_unix.c:3048)\n sock_recvmsg (net/socket.c:1063 (discriminator 20) net/socket.c:1085 (discriminator 20))\n __sys_recvfrom (net/socket.c:2278)\n __x64_sys_recvfrom (net/socket.c:2291 (discriminator 1) net/socket.c:2287 (discriminator 1) net/socket.c:2287 (discriminator 1))\n do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 (discriminator 1) arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94 (discriminator 1))\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)\nRIP: 0033:0x7f8911fcea06\nCode: 5d e8 41 8b 93 08 03 00 00 59 5e 48 83 f8 fc 75 19 83 e2 39 83 fa 08 75 11 e8 26 ff ff ff 66 0f 1f 44 00 00 48 8b 45 10 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 8b 5d f8 c9 c3 0f 1f 40 00 f3 0f 1e fa 55 48 89 e5 48 83 ec 08\nRSP: 002b:00007fffdb0dccb0 EFLAGS: 00000202 ORIG_RAX: 000000000000002d\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007fffdb0dcdc8 RCX: 00007f8911fcea06\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: 00007f8911a5e060 RDI: 0000000000000006\nRBP: 00007fffdb0dccd0 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000202 R12: 00007f89119a7d20\nR13: ffffffffc4653600 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 315:\n kasan_save_stack (mm/kasan/common.c:48)\n kasan_save_track (mm/kasan/common.c:60 (discriminator 1) mm/kasan/common.c:69 (discriminator 1))\n __kasan_slab_alloc (mm/kasan/common.c:348)\n kmem_cache_alloc_\n---truncated---",

          "Title": "kernel: bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration",
          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack\n---truncated---",

[0]\n\nFrom the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while\nits device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.\n\nOnce the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls\nhci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct\nvhci_data, which is set to hci_dev-\u003edev-\u003edriver_data.\n\nThe problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking\nhdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be\nanother thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before\nthe unlink operation.\n\nWe can use SRCU for such synchronisation.\n\nLet's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion\nin hci_unregister_dev().\n\nAnother option would be to restore hci_dev-\u003edestruct(), which was\nremoved in commit 587ae086f6e4 (\"Bluetooth: Remove unused\nhci-destruct cb\").  However, this would not be a good solution, as\nwe should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight\nioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.\n\nNote that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,\nvirtbt_remove().\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88807cb8d858 by task syz.1.219/6718\n\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 6718 Comm: syz.1.219 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-syzkaller-00196-g08207f42d3ff #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/07/2025\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x189/0x250 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:408 [inline]\n print_report+0xd2/0x2b0 mm/kasan/report.c:521\n kasan_report+0x118/0x150 mm/kasan/report.c:634\n skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\n skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\n skb_queue_purge include/linux/skbuff.h:3368 [inline]\n vhci_flush+0x44/0x50 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:69\n hci_dev_do_reset net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:552 [inline]\n hci_dev_reset+0x420/0x5c0 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:592\n sock_do_ioctl+0xd9/0x300 net/socket.c:1190\n sock_ioctl+0x576/0x790 net/socket.c:1311\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:907 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl+0xf9/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:893\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xfa/0x3b0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\nRIP: 0033:0x7fcf5b98e929\nCode: ff ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 a8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007fcf5c7b9038 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007fcf5bbb6160 RCX: 00007fcf5b98e929\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000400448cb RDI: 0000000000000009\nRBP: 00007fcf5ba10b39 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00007fcf5bbb6160 R15: 00007ffd6353d528\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 6535:\n kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n kasan_save_track+0x3e/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n poison_kmalloc_redzone mm/kasan/common.c:377 [inline]\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x93/0xb0 mm/kasan/common.c:394\n kasan_kmalloc include/linux/kasan.h:260 [inline]\n __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x230/0x3d0 mm/slub.c:4359\n kmalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:905 [inline]\n kzalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:1039 [inline]\n vhci_open+0x57/0x360 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:635\n misc_open+0x2bc/0x330 drivers/char/misc.c:161\n chrdev_open+0x4c9/0x5e0 fs/char_dev.c:414\n do_dentry_open+0xdf0/0x1970 fs/open.c:964\n vfs_open+0x3b/0x340 fs/open.c:1094\n do_open fs/namei.c:3887 [inline]\n path_openat+0x2ee5/0x3830 fs/name\n---truncated---",

          "Description": "A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled when certain SUID binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.",

All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.",

However, while ltp running\nstress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it is\npossible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is\ndestroyed eg:\n\n(umount)\next4_kill_sb\n  kill_block_super\n    generic_shutdown_super\n      sync_filesystem /* commits all txns */\n      evict_inodes\n        /* might start a new txn */\n      ext4_put_super\n\tflush_work(\u0026sbi-\u003es_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */\n        jbd2_journal_destroy\n          journal_kill_thread\n            journal-\u003ej_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;\n          jbd2_journal_commit_transaction\n            jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer\n              jbd2_journal_bmap\n                ext4_journal_bmap\n                  ext4_map_blocks\n                    ...\n                    ext4_inode_error\n                      ext4_handle_error\n                        schedule_work(\u0026sbi-\u003es_sb_upd_work)\n\n                                               /* work queue kicks in */\n                                               update_super_work\n                                                 jbd2_journal_start\n                                                   start_this_handle\n                                                     BUG_ON(journal-\u003ej_flags \u0026\n                                                            JBD2_UNMOUNT)\n\nHence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only do\na journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, just\nfallback to an un-journaled commit.\n\nFurther, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:\n\n  1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.",

Use that flag at\nk3_udma_glue_reset_rx_chn() to deicide if the FDQ needs\nto be cleared for every flow or just for flow 0.\n\nFixes the below issue on ti_am65_cpsw_nuss driver on AM62-SK.\n\n\u003e ip link set eth1 down\n\u003e ip link set eth0 down\n\u003e ethtool -L eth0 rx 8\n\u003e ip link set eth0 up\n\u003e modprobe -r ti_am65_cpsw_nuss\n\n[  103.045726] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  103.050505] k3_knav_desc_pool size 512000 != avail 64000\n[  103.050703] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 450 at drivers/net/ethernet/ti/k3-cppi-desc-pool.c:33 k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.068810] Modules linked in: ti_am65_cpsw_nuss(-) k3_cppi_desc_pool snd_soc_hdmi_codec crct10dif_ce snd_soc_simple_card snd_soc_simple_card_utils display_connector rtc_ti_k3 k3_j72xx_bandgap tidss drm_client_lib snd_soc_davinci_mcas\np drm_dma_helper tps6598x phylink snd_soc_ti_udma rti_wdt drm_display_helper snd_soc_tlv320aic3x_i2c typec at24 phy_gmii_sel snd_soc_ti_edma snd_soc_tlv320aic3x sii902x snd_soc_ti_sdma sa2ul omap_mailbox drm_kms_helper authenc cfg80211 r\nfkill fuse drm drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight ip_tables x_tables ipv6 [last unloaded: k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.119950] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 450 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 6.13.0-rc7-00001-g9c5e3435fa66 #1011\n[  103.119968] Hardware name: Texas Instruments AM625 SK (DT)\n[  103.119974] pstate: 80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  103.119983] pc : k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.148007] lr : k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool]\n[  103.154709] sp : ffff8000826ebbc0\n[  103.158015] x29: ffff8000826ebbc0 x28: ffff0000090b6300 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  103.165145] x26: 0000000000000000 x25: 0000000000000000 x24: ffff0000019df6b0\n[  103.172271] x23: ffff0000019df6b8 x22: ffff0000019df410 x21: ffff8000826ebc88\n[  103.179397] x20: 000000000007d000 x19: ffff00000a3b3000 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  103.186522] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000 x15: 000001e8c35e1cde\n[  103.193647] x14: 0000000000000396 x13: 000000000000035c x12: 0000000000000000\n[  103.200772] x11: 000000000000003a x10: 00000000000009c0 x9 : ffff8000826eba20\n[  103.207897] x8 : ffff0000090b6d20 x7 : ffff00007728c180 x6 : ffff00007728c100\n[  103.215022] x5 : 0000000000000001 x4 : ffff000000508a50 x3 : ffff7ffff6146000\n[  103.222147] x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : e300b4173ee6b200 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  103.229274] Call trace:\n[  103.231714]  k3_cppi_desc_pool_destroy+0xa0/0xa8 [k3_cppi_desc_pool] (P)\n[  103.238408]  am65_cpsw_nuss_free_rx_chns+0x28/0x4c [ti_am65_cpsw_nuss]\n[  103.244942]  devm_action_release+0x14/0x20\n[  103.249040]  release_nodes+0x3c/0x68\n[  103.252610]  devres_release_all+0x8c/0xdc\n[  103.256614]  device_unbind_cleanup+0x18/0x60\n[  103.260876]  device_release_driver_internal+0xf8/0x178\n[  103.266004]  driver_detach+0x50/0x9c\n[  103.269571]  bus_remove_driver+0x6c/0xbc\n[  103.273485]  driver_unregister+0x30/0x60\n[  103.277401]  platform_driver_unregister+0x14/0x20\n[  103.282096]  am65_cpsw_nuss_driver_exit+0x18/0xff4 [ti_am65_cpsw_nuss]\n[  103.288620]  __arm64_sys_delete_module+0x17c/0x25c\n[  103.293404]  invoke_syscall+0x44/0x100\n[  103.297149]  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xc0/0xe0\n[  103.301845]  do_el0_svc+0x1c/0x28\n[  103.305155]  el0_svc+0x28/0x98\n---truncated---",

Kexec works fine if virtio-console\nis not in use.\n\nThe issue is that virtio-console continues to write to the MMIO even after\nunderlying virtio-pci device is reset.\n\nAdditionally, Eric noticed that IOMMUs are reset before devices, if\ndevices are not reset on shutdown they continue to poke at guest memory\nand get errors from the IOMMU. Some devices get wedged then.\n\nThe problem can be solved by breaking all virtio devices on virtio\nbus shutdown, then resetting them.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before\n\nCurrently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through\nvm_ops-\u003emay_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are\ntaken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our\nprocess and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to\nbe shared again before we actually perform the split.\n\nFix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from\n__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that\npoint, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.\n\nAn annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper\nhugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:\n\n1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:\n    - mmap lock (exclusively)\n    - VMA lock\n    - file rmap lock (exclusively)\n2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to\n   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently\n   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock\n\nBackporting note:\nThis commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit\nb30c14cd6102 (\"hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs\"); that\ncommit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually\nalso go all the way back.\n\n[jannh@google.com: v2]",

In other cases,\nit could create a memory scribble.\n\nThe server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate\nor pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531\nsays that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected\ninstead with a status of AUTH_ERR.\n\nHandle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of\nAUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case.

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistencies\n\nio_bitmap_exit() is invoked from exit_thread() when a task exists or\nwhen a fork fails. In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up\nresources which were allocated during fork().\n\nio_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up\nin tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the\ncurrent task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,\ntss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThere are two issues, which lead to that problem:\n\n  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when\n     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a\n     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().\n\n  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap\n     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.\n\n     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of\n     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread\n     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.\n\n     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because\n     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and\n     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().\n\nCure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:\n\n  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if\n     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.\n\n  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user\n     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in\n     io_bitmap_share().\n\nFor paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch\nthe case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.",

But some\npackets with modified geometry can also hit bugs in that code. We don't\nknow how many such cases exist. Addressing each one by one also requires\ntouching the complex skb_segment code, which risks introducing bugs for\nother types of skbs. Instead, linearize all these packets that fail the\nbasic invariants on gso fraglist skbs. That is more robust.\n\nIf only part of the fraglist payload is pulled into head_skb, it will\nalways cause exception when splitting skbs by skb_segment. For detailed\ncall stack information, see below.\n\nValid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs\n- consist of two or more segments\n- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size\n- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment\n- all but the last must be gso_size\n\nOptional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can\nmodify fraglist skbs, breaking these invariants.\n\nIn extreme cases they pull one part of data into skb linear. For UDP,\nthis  causes three payloads with lengths of (11,11,10) bytes were\npulled tail to become (12,10,10) bytes.\n\nThe skbs no longer meets the above SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST conditions because\npayload was pulled into head_skb, it needs to be linearized before pass\nto regular skb_segment.\n\n    skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    __udp_gso_segment+0x334/0x5f4\n    udp4_ufo_fragment+0x118/0x15c\n    inet_gso_segment+0x164/0x338\n    skb_mac_gso_segment+0xc4/0x13c\n    __skb_gso_segment+0xc4/0x124\n    validate_xmit_skb+0x9c/0x2c0\n    validate_xmit_skb_list+0x4c/0x80\n    sch_direct_xmit+0x70/0x404\n    __dev_queue_xmit+0x64c/0xe5c\n    neigh_resolve_output+0x178/0x1c4\n    ip_finish_output2+0x37c/0x47c\n    __ip_finish_output+0x194/0x240\n    ip_finish_output+0x20/0xf4\n    ip_output+0x100/0x1a0\n    NF_HOOK+0xc4/0x16c\n    ip_forward+0x314/0x32c\n    ip_rcv+0x90/0x118\n    __netif_receive_skb+0x74/0x124\n    process_backlog+0xe8/0x1a4\n    __napi_poll+0x5c/0x1f8\n    net_rx_action+0x154/0x314\n    handle_softirqs+0x154/0x4b8\n\n    [118.376811] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:bug\u0026]kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:4278!\n    [118.376829] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:traps\u0026]Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n    [118.470774] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]Kernel Offset: 0x178cc00000 from 0xffffffc008000000\n    [118.470810] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]PHYS_OFFSET: 0x40000000\n    [118.470827] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO)\n    [118.470848] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pc : [0xffffffd79598aefc] skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    [118.470900] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]lr : [0xffffffd79598a5e8] skb_segment+0x3bc/0xd14\n    [118.470928] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]sp : ffffffc008013770",

If the device was already zoned,\ndisk-\u003enr_zones would always equal md-\u003enr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()\nreturned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for\nthe device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug\nresources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading\ninvalid memory because disk-\u003econv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.\n\nIf the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the\ncurrent disk-\u003enr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous\nvalue of disk-\u003enr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to\nmatch the previous value that it fell back to.\n\nIf the device already has zone write plug resources,\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is\ncalled for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need\nfor this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads\nthat change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug\nresources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources\nallocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates\nzone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A\ndevice can switch to an error target.",

Also, it is possible that md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map will change\nwhile calling this function. Only read it once, so that we are always\nusing the same value. Otherwise we might miss a call to\ndm_put_live_table().\n\nFinally, while md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map is set and a process is calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() to set up the zone append emulation\nresources, it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by\nblkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones(). If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while\nthe other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error.\n\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will only ever be called when initially\nsetting up the zone append emulation resources, such as when setting up\na zoned dm-crypt table for the first time. Further table swaps will not\nset md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map or call blk_revalidate_disk_zones().\nHowever it must be called using the new table (referenced by\nmd-\u003ezone_revalidate_map) and the new queue limits while the DM device is\nsuspended. dm_blk_report_zones() needs some way to distinguish between a\ncall from blk_revalidate_disk_zones(), which must be allowed to use\nmd-\u003ezone_revalidate_map to access this not yet activated table, and all\nother calls to dm_blk_report_zones(), which should not be allowed while\nthe device is suspended and cannot use md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map, since\nthe zone resources might be freed by the process currently calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones().\n\nSolve this by tracking the process that sets md-\u003ezone_revalidate_map in\ndm_revalidate_zones() and only allowing that process to make use of it\nin dm_blk_report_zones().",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: clear phydev-\u003edevlink when the link is deleted\n\nThere is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the\nnetwork port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls\ndevice_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear\nphydev-\u003edevlink, so phydev-\u003edevlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the\nnetwork port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before\ncalling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the \"error\" label and\ncalls phy_detach(). Since phydev-\u003edevlink retains the old value from\nthe previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,\nwhich accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash\nlog is as follows.\n\n[   24.702421] Call trace:\n[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120\n[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48\n[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168\n[   24.716261]  phy_attach_direct+0x168/0x3a4\n[   24.720352]  phylink_fwnode_phy_connect+0xc8/0x14c\n[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34\n\nTherefore, phydev-\u003edevlink needs to be cleared when the device link is\ndeleted.",

          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps\n\nThe logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state\nincorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having\nTIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state\nis stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from\ndo_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:\n\n|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */\n|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))\n|                WARN_ON(1);\n\nThis is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:\n\n  751ecf6afd6568ad (\"arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps\")\n\nThe race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and\nafter manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on\nthe same CPU, e.g.\n\n| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)\n| {\n|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled\n|         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is 0.\n|         // per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.\n|\n|         ...\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.\n|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.\n|\n|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */\n|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))\n|                 WARN_ON(1);\n|\n|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {\n|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =\n|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;\n|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);\n|\n|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();\n|         }\n|\n|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.\n|         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is still 0\n|         // If per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:\n|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)\n|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared\n|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore\n| }\n\nFix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set\nby calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU\nstate. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the\nstale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the\nnew state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.\n\nNote: this was originallly posted as [1].\n\n[ Rutland: rewrite commit message ]",

The error can be converted to -EINVAL.",

[0]\n\nThe NULL is of struct sock, which was fetched by sk_to_full_sk() in\ncalipso_req_setattr().\n\nSince commit a1a5344ddbe8 (\"tcp: avoid two atomic ops for syncookies\"),\nreqsk-\u003ersk_listener could be NULL when SYN Cookie is returned to its\nclient, as hinted by the leading SYN Cookie log.\n\nHere are 3 options to fix the bug:\n\n  1) Return 0 in calipso_req_setattr()\n  2) Return an error in calipso_req_setattr()\n  3) Alaways set rsk_listener\n\n1) is no go as it bypasses LSM, but 2) effectively disables SYN Cookie\nfor CALIPSO.  3) is also no go as there have been many efforts to reduce\natomic ops and make TCP robust against DDoS.  See also commit 3b24d854cb35\n(\"tcp/dccp: do not touch listener sk_refcnt under synflood\").\n\nAs of the blamed commit, SYN Cookie already did not need refcounting,\nand no one has stumbled on the bug for 9 years, so no CALIPSO user will\ncare about SYN Cookie.\n\nLet's return an error in calipso_req_setattr() and calipso_req_delattr()\nin the SYN Cookie case.\n\nThis can be reproduced by [1] on Fedora and now connect() of nc times out.\n\n[0]:\nTCP: request_sock_TCPv6: Possible SYN flooding on port [::]:20002.

There is no mechanism for the kernel to find and delete all\ncreated config-items. Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an\nexpectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause\nestablished config-item access to start failing.\n\nThat expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),\ntsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail\nif tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()\ntsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the\nmissing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.\n\nNow, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,\nit leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The\nexpectation is that the admin that arranges for the -\u003eremove() (unbind)\nof the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all\nopen config-items. Until that deletion happens, -\u003eprobe() (reload /\nbind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.\n\nThis allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation\ninterfaces, and requires coordinated restart.",

          "Title": "kernel: bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration",
          "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack\n---truncated---",

[0]\n\nFrom the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while\nits device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.\n\nOnce the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls\nhci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct\nvhci_data, which is set to hci_dev-\u003edev-\u003edriver_data.\n\nThe problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking\nhdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be\nanother thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before\nthe unlink operation.\n\nWe can use SRCU for such synchronisation.\n\nLet's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion\nin hci_unregister_dev().\n\nAnother option would be to restore hci_dev-\u003edestruct(), which was\nremoved in commit 587ae086f6e4 (\"Bluetooth: Remove unused\nhci-destruct cb\").  However, this would not be a good solution, as\nwe should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight\nioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.\n\nNote that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,\nvirtbt_remove().\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88807cb8d858 by task syz.1.219/6718\n\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 6718 Comm: syz.1.219 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-syzkaller-00196-g08207f42d3ff #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/07/2025\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x189/0x250 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:408 [inline]\n print_report+0xd2/0x2b0 mm/kasan/report.c:521\n kasan_report+0x118/0x150 mm/kasan/report.c:634\n skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\n skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\n skb_queue_purge include/linux/skbuff.h:3368 [inline]\n vhci_flush+0x44/0x50 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:69\n hci_dev_do_reset net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:552 [inline]\n hci_dev_reset+0x420/0x5c0 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:592\n sock_do_ioctl+0xd9/0x300 net/socket.c:1190\n sock_ioctl+0x576/0x790 net/socket.c:1311\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:907 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl+0xf9/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:893\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xfa/0x3b0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\nRIP: 0033:0x7fcf5b98e929\nCode: ff ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 a8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007fcf5c7b9038 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007fcf5bbb6160 RCX: 00007fcf5b98e929\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000400448cb RDI: 0000000000000009\nRBP: 00007fcf5ba10b39 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00007fcf5bbb6160 R15: 00007ffd6353d528\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 6535:\n kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n kasan_save_track+0x3e/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n poison_kmalloc_redzone mm/kasan/common.c:377 [inline]\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x93/0xb0 mm/kasan/common.c:394\n kasan_kmalloc include/linux/kasan.h:260 [inline]\n __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x230/0x3d0 mm/slub.c:4359\n kmalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:905 [inline]\n kzalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:1039 [inline]\n vhci_open+0x57/0x360 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:635\n misc_open+0x2bc/0x330 drivers/char/misc.c:161\n chrdev_open+0x4c9/0x5e0 fs/char_dev.c:414\n do_dentry_open+0xdf0/0x1970 fs/open.c:964\n vfs_open+0x3b/0x340 fs/open.c:1094\n do_open fs/namei.c:3887 [inline]\n path_openat+0x2ee5/0x3830 fs/name\n---truncated---",

See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information.\n\nNote that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from \"no filtering\" to `\"data\", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.\n\nNote that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process.
